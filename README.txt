This is my code resprository of the exercises I did from the book titled "Think Like a Programmer". I haven't solved all the exercises, but I'll revisit the unsolved ones and solve the ones that I know would give me the most struggle.

I have yet to add Chapter 8.

If some exercise isn't included in the "Unsolved exercises" section of the chapter notes, that is because that exercise is most likely a question and not a task to write code for.

Any suggestions and code improvements are welcome.
