Notes:

Suprisingly, Exercise 3 has been pretty difficult for me at the time I was solving it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unsolved exercises:

4. Design your own: Think up your own symmetrical pattern of hash marks, and see whether you can write a program to produce it that follows the shapes rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. If you like the Luhn formula problem, try writing a program for a different check-digit system, like the 13-digit ISBN system. The program could take an identification number and verify it or take a number without its check digit and generate the check digit.

Notes on exercise 5:

 - I remember solving exercise 5, but I can't find the code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Want an extra challenge? Generalize the code for the previous exercise to make a program that converts from any number base-16 or less to any other number base. So, for example, the program could convert from base-9 to base-4.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Write a program that reads a line of text, counting the number of words, identifying the length of the longest word, the greatest number of vowels in a word, and/or any other statistics you can think of.
