Unsolved exercises:

2. Rewrite the code that finds the agent with the best monthly sales average so that it finds the agent with the highest median sales. As stated earlier, the median of a set of values is the “one in the middle,” such that half of the other values are higher and half of the other values are lower. If there is an even number of values, the median is the simple average of the two values in the middle. For example, in the set 10, 6, 2, 14, 7, 9, the values in the middle are 7 and 9. The average of 7 and 9 is 8, so 8 is the median.

4.Here’s a variation on the array of const values. Write a program for creating a substitution cipher problem. In a substitution cipher problem, all messages are made of uppercase letters and punctuation. The original message is called the plaintext, and you create the ciphertext by substituting each letter with another letter (for example, each C could become an X). For this problem, hard-code a const array of 26 char elements for the cipher, and have your program read a plaintext message and output the equivalent ciphertext.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Have the previous program convert the ciphertext back to the plaintext to verify the encoding and decoding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. To make the ciphertext problem even more challenging, have your program randomly generate the cipher array instead of a hard-coded const array. Effectively, this means placing a random character in each element of the array, but remember that you can’t substitute a letter for itself. So the first element can’t be A, and you can’t use the same letter for two substitutions—that is, if the first element is S, no other element can be S.

 - I don't know why I haven't solved exercises 4-6... They seem fun and interesting... Will do!
