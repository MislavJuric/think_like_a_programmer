Unsolved exercises:

4. Design your own: Find a problem processing a one-dimension array that you have already solved or that is trivial for you at your current skill level, and solve the problem (or solve it again) using recursion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Design your own: Try to discover a linked-list processing problem that is difficult to solve using iteration but can be solved directly using recursion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------12. Design your own: Consider basic statistical questions you can ask of a set of numerical values, such as average, median, mode, and so forth. Attempt to write recursive functions to compute those statistics for a binary tree of integers. Some are easier to write than others. Why?
